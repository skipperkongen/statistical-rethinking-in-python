# Statistical Rethinking in Python

See the [playlist on Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) for the full video lectures by Richard McElreath. Also check out the corresponding [Github repository](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023) (2023 version, R).  

Because I work in Python, I am creating my own lecture notebooks in Python as I progress through the course:

1. [Golem of Prague](./notebooks/1_golems_owls.ipynb)
1. [Garden of Forking Data](./notebooks/2_gardenforkingdata.ipynb)
1. [Geocentric models](./notebooks/3_geocentric_models.ipynb)

Also check out the side quests:

- [Quadratic Approximation](./notebooks/sidequests/quadratic_approximation.ipynb)
